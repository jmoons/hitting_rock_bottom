Setup reading of input file
1) Get units of water, store in constant
2) each row will be represented in a array representation of that row's map data split into individual characters
3) each row becomes an element of an array - array[0] = top of map, array[last] = bottom of map
4) Need to determine best data structure for depths of each column

Iterate through the units of water
1) Start at the last row of the array, and add water to lowest, left-most point. If row is full (before rock or wall), move up one row.
2) When water is added, increment that columns depth record.
